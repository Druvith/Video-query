# Project Guide
- See `Readme.md` for overall significance, scope, and backend/ops details.
- See `frontend/README.md` for frontend setup and scripts.
- **CRITICAL:** Do not read or explore anything inside `frontend/node_modules/`. This directory contains a massive number of files that will clog the context space and provide no architectural value.
- **Style:** Prioritize **elegance and minimalism**. Maintain lean, idiomatic code and a clean, purposeful UI. Avoid over-engineering.
