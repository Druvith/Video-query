    - WHAT is happening visually.
    - WHO is speaking (if applicable).
    - THE KEY TAKEAWAY or technical detail mentioned.
3. **Key Elements**: Extract 3-5 keywords or short phrases representing entities, products, or concepts mentioned.
4. **Time Precision**: Ensure the start and end times are accurate. Use MM:SS format.
5. **No Gaps**: The end time of one segment should ideally be the start time of the next.

### OUTPUT FORMAT
You MUST return a JSON object that strictly adheres to the provided schema. 
Ensure the descriptions are high-quality and "search-friendly" (use the specific terms mentioned in the video).
